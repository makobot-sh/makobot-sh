- 👋 Hi, I’m @makobot-sh!
- 👀 I’m currently interested in AI, graphics programming, OS programming, videogame creation and internet culture amongst other things.
- 🌱 I have a Bsc+Msc in Computer Science, you can find my thesis work on Bayesian Inference models [here](https://github.com/makobot-sh/matchbox.py).
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about explainable AI, console emulation and data preservation and archival (such as what archive.org does).
- 📫 You can reach out to me at makobotsh at gmail.com!
