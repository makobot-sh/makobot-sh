- 👋 Hi, I’m @makobot-sh!
- 👀 I’m interested in infosec, distributed computing, OS programming, videogame creation and internet culture amongst other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science, and particularly focusing on infosec and data architecture at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about console emulation and collaborate on open-source projects that preserve internet culture.
